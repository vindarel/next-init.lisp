#| @section My Next browser init file

- @link{https://github.com/next-browser/next}{Next browser}
- @link{https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org}{Next manual.org}

We're writing it in literate programing with @link{https://github.com/mmontone/erudite}{erudite}.

---
The command required to produce the readme is:

@verbatim
(erudite:erudite #p"README.md" "init.lisp" :output-type :markdown :syntax :erudite)
@end verbatim

About Erudite:

We currently use the erudite syntax and produce markdown output. It
will be possible in the next version (or now if you add a missing piece,
see the issues) to use markdown for input and output (but probably not
to produce other output).

A @emph{C-c ~} in Slime is useful to sync the package and directory.

If not specified, all code is written in the next package.

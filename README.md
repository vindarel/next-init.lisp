# My Next browser init file


- [Next browser](https://github.com/next-browser/next)
- [Next manual.org](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/documents/MANUAL.org)

We're writing it in literate programing with [erudite](https://github.com/mmontone/erudite).

---
The command required to produce the readme is:

```
(erudite:erudite #p"README.md" "init.lisp" :output-type :markdown :syntax :erudite)
```

About Erudite:

We currently use the erudite syntax and produce markdown output. It
will be possible in the next version (or now if you add a missing piece,
see the issues) to use markdown for input and output (but probably not
to produce other output).

A *C-c ~* in Slime is useful to sync the package and directory.

---
If not specified, all code is written in the next package.

```lisp

(in-package :next)

```

# Commands configuration


## Open files with my preferred program


```lisp

(defun my-open-files (filename)
  "Open videos with mpv, directories with emacsclient."
  (let ((args)
        (extension (pathname-type filename)))
    (cond
      ((uiop:directory-pathname-p filename)
       (log:info "Opening ~a with emacsclient." filename)
       (setf args (list "emacsclient" filename)))

      ((member extension '("flv" "mkv" "mp4") :test #'string-equal)
       (setf args (list "mpv" filename))))

    (handler-case (if args
                      (uiop:launch-program args)
                      (next/file-manager-mode:open-file-function filename))

# Hooks


## Old reddit hook


```lisp

(defun old-reddit-hook (url)
  "Enforce old reddit."
  (let* ((uri (quri:uri url)))
    (if (search "www.reddit" (quri:uri-host uri))
        (progn
          (setf (quri:uri-host uri) "old.reddit.com")
          (let ((new-url (quri:render-uri uri)))
            (log:info "Switching to old Reddit: ~a" new-url)
            new-url))
        url)))
(add-to-default-list #'old-reddit-hook 'buffer 'load-hook)

```

## Facebook to Diaspora hook

For *you* who shouldn't use Facebook ;)

```lisp
(defun no-facebook-hook (url)
  "Always redirect to Diaspora."
  (let ((uri (quri:uri url)))
    (if (search "facebook.com" (quri:uri-host uri))
        (progn
          (setf (quri:uri-host uri) "pod.geraspora.de")
          (let ((new-url (quri:render-uri uri)))
            (log:info "You shall not go to Facebook!" new-url)
            new-url))
        url)))
(add-to-default-list #'no-facebook-hook 'buffer 'load-hook)

```


## Unused hooks

These  are  workingÂ©,  but  I  don't  use  them  (they're  either  too
revolutionnary either too dumb :p ).


### Automatically download Youtube videos


```lisp

(defun auto-yt-dl (url)
  "Download this url asynchronously to /tmp/videos, according youtube-dl is installed globally."
  (when (search "www.youtube.com" url)
    (log:info "Youtube: downloading ~a" url)
    (uiop:launch-program (list "youtube-dl" url "-o" "/tmp/videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s")))
  url)
(format t "when finished, do: add-to-default-list #'auto-yt-dl 'buffer 'load-hook")

### FIP radio

Save the current playing song's title into a text file.
Caution: it seems the website can lag to a couple minutes behind the music :S At least we also save the current time, so we could go back search for the title.

```lisp

(defparameter *fip-home-url* "https://www.fip.fr/")

(defparameter *fip-database-file* #p"~/.config/next/fip.txt"
              "Where to save our songs.")

```
we'll want to add dependencies to the binary.

```lisp
(ql:quickload '("lquery"
                "access"
```
"dexador" ;; in Next.
"local-time" ;; in Next.

```lisp
                ))

(defun fip-current-song ()
  "Return the artist, the song, the year (multiple values)."
  (handler-case
      (let* ((html (dex:get *fip-home-url*))
             (parsed (lquery:$ (initialize html)))
             (title (access:access ;; get first elt of vector, don't fail if out of bounds.
                     (lquery:$ parsed ".now-info-title" (text)) ; returns a vector.
                     0))
             (artist/year (access:access
                           (lquery:$ parsed ".now-info-subtitle" (text))
                           0))
             (matches (when artist/year
```
returns a vector with the matched strings.
see the Cookbook.

```lisp
                        (nth-value 1 (ppcre:scan-to-strings "\(.*\) \((.*\))" artist/year))))

        (format t "FIP: artist: ~a, song ~a, year ~a~&" artist title year)
        (values artist title year))
